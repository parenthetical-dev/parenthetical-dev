# Contributing to Parenthetical

Welcome to the margins—where the most important work happens.

## Our Commitment to Contributors

Before we talk about code standards or pull requests, let's be clear about who we are and what we're building together. Parenthetical exists to create technology that amplifies marginalized voices and builds digital spaces where humanity thrives. Every contribution—whether it's fixing a typo or architecting a new feature—is part of this larger mission.

This is a space for everyone, especially those who've been pushed to the margins of tech. We actively welcome contributors who are:

- Anyone who's been told they "don't look like a developer"

- Unwelcome comments about lifestyle choices
- Deliberate misgendering or use of rejected names
- Sexual images or language in any context
- Physical contact without consent

## Before You Contribute

1. **Understand the mission** - Read our README and explore existing projects. Every line of code should align with our goal of building tech for social good.

2. **Check existing issues** - Someone might already be working on your idea. Collaboration > competition.

3. **Start small** - Your first contribution doesn't need to change the world. Fix a bug, improve docs, or add tests. We celebrate all contributions.

4. **Ask questions** - Stuck? Confused? Wondering if your idea aligns with our mission? Open an issue. We're here to help.

## How to Contribute

### Reporting Bugs

Found something broken? You're helping us build better.

- Check if the bug already exists in issues
- Create a detailed bug report using our template
- Include context about how this bug might impact users
- Security vulnerabilities? Use GitHub Security Advisories to report privately

### Suggesting Features

Have an idea that could serve our communities better?

- Open a feature request issue
- Explain who this helps and why it matters
- Consider: Does this make our platforms more accessible? More secure? More inclusive?
- Be ready to discuss implementation and impact

### Improving Documentation

Documentation is how we show care for future contributors.

- Fix typos, clarify confusing sections, add examples
- Write guides for specific use cases
- Translate documentation to make our projects globally accessible
- Add code comments that explain the "why," not just the "what"

### Contributing Code

**Setup:**
1. Fork the repository
2. Clone your fork locally
3. Install dependencies with `npm install`
4. Create a new branch: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name`

**Development:**
- Write clean, readable code that prioritizes clarity over cleverness
- Follow existing code style (Prettier and ESLint)
- Test accessibility with screen readers and keyboard navigation
- Consider performance on older devices and slower connections
- Add tests for new features
- Update documentation as needed

**Submission:**
- Commit with clear, meaningful messages
- Push to your fork
- Open a pull request with context and screenshots

## Technical Guidelines

### Frontend (React/Next.js)
- Components should be accessible by default
- Use semantic HTML
- Include ARIA labels where needed
- Ensure keyboard navigation works
- Test with screen readers
- Mobile-first responsive design

### Backend (Node.js/Python)
- Security first: validate inputs, sanitize outputs
- Privacy by design: minimal data, encryption
- Clear and consistent API responses
- Helpful error messages without exposing details
- Consider rate limiting to prevent abuse

### AI/ML Integration
- Document any biases in models or datasets
- Ensure AI enhances rather than replaces human agency
- Make AI decisions explainable where possible
- Always provide non-AI fallbacks

### General Standards
- **Accessibility:** WCAG 2.1 AA compliance minimum
- **Performance:** Test on 3G and older devices
- **Security:** Follow OWASP guidelines
- **Privacy:** GDPR-compliant by default
- **Testing:** 80% coverage, 100% for critical paths

## Review Process

### What we look for:
- **Mission alignment:** Does this serve our communities?
- **Code quality:** Is it maintainable and understandable?
- **Impact:** Does it make our platforms better for users?
- **Accessibility:** Is it usable by everyone?
- **Security:** Does it protect vulnerable users?

### Timeline:
- We aim to respond to all PRs within 72 hours
- Reviews might include suggestions, questions, or requests for changes
- We celebrate iteration—perfect is the enemy of good enough to help someone

## Recognition

We believe in celebrating our contributors:

- **README Credits:** All contributors added
- **Release Notes:** Significant contributions highlighted
- **Permissions:** Regular contributors gain access
- **Wider Recognition:** Community nominations

## A Final Note

Your contribution matters—not because of its size or complexity, but because it's part of building technology that serves rather than exploits. Whether you're fixing a semicolon or reimagining our architecture, you're adding essential context to the future we're building.

**Every parenthetical counts. Every voice matters. Every contribution moves us closer to technology that truly serves humanity.**
